Anne, her auburn hair glinting in the late afternoon’s slanting sun sat down with her cup of tea and the apron she was working on embroidering and took a considering look at the women gathered around her. Rachel Lynde, the Sewing Circle’s Historian sat darning a pile of socks her faced creased into its perpetually sour expression. When Anne had first moved into Marilla’s care she had thought Mrs. Lynde a shrewish bully of a woman but now she understood her better and the burden of knowledge she lived under. The Sewing Circles historian was the receptacle of the entire occult history of the organization from it’s birth under the watchful eye of Our Huntress Mother of the White Woods to the present and Anne imagined that that would be…painful. Besides her, with their mouth set in a grim line as if the embroidery hoop she was working on was a mortal enemy sat Marilla Cuthbert, head Abbess of the Sewing Circle and the firm iron hand that steered their course the the secret wars that had been a part of life on Prince Edward Island from the arrival of the first settlers and possibly even before. She was also Anne’s adopted mother. And then there was Diana. Anne couldn't help but smile at her raven haired bosom friend as she frowned prettily at her darning needles. Anne had seen her bury those same needles into the eye socket of a nameless shambling horror just the month before and wipe them off on her apron without a change in expression so it was amusing to see this feigned fumbling with yarn.",
