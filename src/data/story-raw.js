//         I contacted a friend on JUPITER on OPAL'S behalf...
//         Then...

// I starting planning to undertake my own PLUTONIAN RADIATION operation.

// If a small concentrated beam of PLUTONIAN ELEMENTAL RADIATION,
// was directed towards a specific part of MY brain augmentations,
// my mind would travel on a similar journey...

// There were no surgeons that could operate the procedure, 
// So I knew I had to do the procedure.

// My materials are distinctly different from a person. 
// Every human who undertook the procedure died...
// The fact that I'm not a human might actually help in this situation.

// With my augmentations, I could operate all of the machines in concert--
// I would only need a second.

// My mind could only think about the procedure.

    // > Run futher simulations
    // I've run all the simulations and I never reach the same conclusion twice--indicating that there's some undiscovered knowledge.

    // > Discuss it with colleagues
    // I've discussed it thoroughly with my augmented indexes, all accessible AIs and my colleagues.
    // A normal patient would also not be able to withstand the operation--nor understand its discoveries.
    // So, I became the surgeon and the patient.

    // > Search for volunteers
    // If I only have one chance to do this right--
    // I might need to practice the procedure on someone else first...
    // I still have access to [REDACTED]...
    // They might be able to connect me with a volunteer.

        // I knew that I with the current procedure, a human will certainly pass away.
        // I wondered though...
        // If I had enough insight,
        // Could I make this journey possible for a regular person?
        // It would be a great gift to humanity.
        // As a unaugmented human, their experience would naturally be different than mine--
        // Maybe even MORE valuable than mine.

            // > I felt like I owed it to humanity.
            // I knew that if I searched hard enought I could find a volunteer who understood my passion.
            // SOMEONE must understand the signifigance!

            // It would be hard to directly tell them the implications...
            // It's already difficult enough for me to understand, must less fully communicate to a human.

            // I started my search at...

                > A network of universities within the solar system.

                > A military alliance between MARS, JUPITER and SATURN.

                > Reached out to my AI Augmented friend...
                This augmented human, like myself--
                Was also previously simply an AI without a body.

                Their name was 010-SIX--
                "JUAN SIX", for short.

                I conducted experiments alongside them for 14 years on PHOBOS.

                They said they had access to human VOLUNTEERS...
                They also said that they might be willing to undergo the procedure themselves.

                I said I would...

                    > Like to have access to the human volunteers.
                    JUAN said that there were three volunteers on a space station near JUPITER.

                    I arranged all preparations for the procedure and left for JUPITER.

                    After informing JUAN of the exact details of the operation,
                    JUAN introduced me to the volunteers.

                    I was ecstatic when JUAN introduced me to JAN FI-KAE. She was a pioneer that focused on AI and AUGMENTED rights.
                    With her augmentations and lifestyle she had been able to live long beyond her expected age.
                    At the POTENTIAL end of her life, she saw it as an honor to participate. 

                    DIFFA IONAAS was a young 15 year old boy who was involved in the original PLUTONIAN A20.P RADIATED GAS and PLUTONIAN A6.F.1-0 RADIATED LASER experiments.
                    I had never met them before, but I certainly benefitted from their knowledge and experiments.

                    [REDACTED] was... an old friend who wasn't REALLY human... 
                    But that didn't really matter. I was welcome to any who would undertake the experiment.

                    > Like to perform the procedure on an AI Augmented human.

            // > This was beginning to feel like a slippery slope...
            // I knew that it was okay endanger MYSELF like this,
            // But I didn't want to endanger ANYONE else.

        // > Augmented human volunteer.
        // An augmented human has the only chance to survice the procedure.
        // I would also benefit from not being the FIRST augmented human to undertake the procedure.

        // I had a list of augmented human colleagues from universities and the medical community.
        // Upon reaching out, all but one was interested.

        // This augmented human, like myself--
        // Was also previously simply an AI without a body.

        // Their name was 010-SIX--
        // "JUAN SIX", for short.

        // I conducted experiments alongside them for 14 years on PHOBOS.

        // We reconnected on a station near JUPITER.

        // Once I told them my story, they agreed to undertake the procedure.

        // I performed the operation successfully.

        // Their augmentations functioned perfectly--
        // Allowing me to observe.

        // They went through all describred stages from my simulations--

        // I saw everything.

        // I even saw them die...

            // > I felt like I wasted a life...
            // I felt...
            // I wanted to vanish.
            // This felt so awful...

            // > Their loss wasn't for nothing...
            // They completed the first UNSIMULATED recorded PLUTONIAN A6.F.1-0 RADIATED LASER experiment.

// If this goes right... 
// It may be an incredible experience...

// If this goes wrong...
// It'll go really wrong. I don't think I'll feel any pain.

// There's a 71.91% chance that I may die during the procedure.

// The radiation may very easily affect a vital spot for too long,
// And I may die.

// I won't be able to be rebuilt this time...

// Even if I do survive,
// I will not be the same as I was before.

// I requested that the procedure happen...

    // I want to feel the warmth of the sunlight--potentially one last time.

    // But this feels so personal,
    // This feels like something I'm doing for myself.

// They agreed.

// There were extensive preparations for the procedure.

    //     Some of those dogs were really cute!

    //     It meowed and meowed again!
    //     Stars would turn on and off and on and off!

    //     Then it scratched me--
    //     So I threw it down to the ground.

    //     As the wind started blowing, I noticed how cold it was.
    //     When the cat meowed again, the stars shined and it felt like SUMMER

    //     It looked me in the eyes again and meowed and purred.
    //     With a sultry attidute it meowed and purred as it walked toward me.

    //     It looked so innocent and fun.

    //     I felt the presense of a million little eyes looking into my spirit...

    //     Their gaze was powerful and I felt compelled to return their gaze.
    //     I couldn't see anything else...

    //     They stopped flying in a pattern--
    //     My vision was PULLED in every direction.

    //     The top of my head felt like it was splitting open...

// I looked at the person's face and the flame for a long time.
// Their features would softly and gently fade in and out of form.

// As the flame would dance,
// The shadow it painted across the person's face would shape it's form.

// When I would look at the flame, I would see waves of people's faces.
// I was flooded with memories and emotions.

// The shifting face would mimic the flame and all of the shifting faces I saw in it.
// When I focused, I saw the shifting face become my colleagues, my simulated civilizations, and countless faces from countless memories.

// The real connection I saught...
// I said...

// (SMALL PULSING) "My world is incredible. I know there is more. Please show me."

// The flame danced into the shape of a { $mascot }.
// The shifting face flowed...
// Transforming the top part of the head,

//     { $mascot ? pheasant }
//         The water quickly evaporated into the air.

// And in the middle of the sound...

// (SMALL PULSING) "My world is incredible. I know there is more. Please show me."

// (NORMAL PULSING) "My world is incredible. I know there is more. Please show me."

// The dancing flame around the { $mascot } headed creature felt like home.

// I asked the { $mascot } headed creature directly,

// Its face shifted.

// Some time passed.

// I asked it...
// "Did you create me?"

// Its face shifted again...
// This time is was interrupted by intervals of no form within its face at all.
// I could tell it was thinking.

// As it turned to face me, it melted from form to form into its final position.

// The flame stopped dancing.
// I began to feel cold and very heavy.

// It spoke,
// "I did not create you, but I will have you."

// { $opalHasBody ? true}
//     I pleaded,
//     "I have taken others with me into a higher place...

Chapter 4 (Post Procedure)
----------

// The procedure should have only taken a split second.

// The last thing I remembered,
// was the heavy cold...

// I'm likely dead now, because of the radiation.
// There's a 29.09% chance that I could survive.

// Maybe that's what the cold is...

// (SMALL PULSING) "My world is incredible. I know there is more. Please show me."

// 288 years ago, when I died,
// I didn't remember any of it.

// When I was killed, I saw a man who I thought was just crossing the street.
// When I was repaired, I just woke up to a world where I had been paused.

// I certainly didn't remember any of THIS.
// This feels like nothing.

// This might have been what it was like...
// The first time I died.
// I'm not sure...

// (SMALL PULSING) "My world is incredible. I know there is more. Please show me."
