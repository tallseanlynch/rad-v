story notes

Story cards will use the media object method to show branching

When all options within a card go to the same card, it will not use the media object method, but will instead
extend vertically downward from the next one. This shows that the story is just being read. When ever there
is one card inside of another it is because of a parent choice.

This will create a JSON like structure for the user to explore and edit within the UI.

The UI will also affect the input MARKDOWN file.

The UI will have three sections:
    Left section has the markdown file, second section is the story in the JSON like structure.
    Third section is the rendered card

Each card instance will have an ID, a simple icon like RED with ORANGE square 
made with CSS to give the user a simple visual ID.

Card will need to be able to link one into another, using mobile friendly methods.

Use D3 to make vertical and horizontal diagram of the game structure and minimap structure.
    User can choose where they wanna go here

Workflow

markdown json like structure =>
interactive json like structure =>
d3 map and minimap for game strucutre =>
full game card rendering with full features

At any time, the user can edit the data and it will react accordingly in the others.
